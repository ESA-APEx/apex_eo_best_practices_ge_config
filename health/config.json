It’s created by combining environmental satellite observations (temperature, vegetation, precipitation proxies) with epidemiological/mosquito-ecology models to estimate where conditions favor mosquito survival and viral transmission. For public health teams it’s useful as an early-warning map to prioritize mosquito control, targeted surveillance, and community warnings at a neighborhood scale rather than just county level.",

Produced by combining historical SST records (satellite and/or reanalyses) with ecological thresholds for Vibrio proliferation to show where and when public-health risks from seawater exposure or seafood consumption are elevated. Uses include seasonal bathing advisories, fisheries monitoring, and studies of climate-driven pathogen expansion. Methods adapted from Baker-Austin et al., 2013 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1628).",

After cloud masking, a median composite (2024) was generated, and albedo was calculated as a weighted linear combination of Sentinel-2 bands (B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12). The resulting product represents the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected by the surface at 10 m resolution, suitable for analyzing urban reflectivity and surface energy balance over ESA ESRIN Campus. An albedo map shows how much sunlight the surface reflects: lower values (darker colors) indicate surfaces that absorb more heat, while higher values (warmer colors) indicate brighter surfaces that reflect more sunlight."
